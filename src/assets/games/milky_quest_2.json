    "description": "This game has an uncensor patch! Refer to this post for more: https://f95zone.to/threads/milky-quest-ii-final-bluehat.116119/post-8070434<br><br>More monsters, more animations, a similar yet slightly revamped battle system (that is a million times more fun) - If you already liked the first Milky Quest, you'll love this one. In about 5-8h of playtime you essentially become a witch's little helper, fight-fuck monster girls and catch them with pills pokemon-style. Unlike the first game, there is also some proper plot carrying the game. Only thing that might be disappointing at first is that it isn't really a sequel of Milky Quest 1, but you'll see what I mean if you have already played the first title.<br>(Oh, also, apparently the author is already working on a 3rd game.)"
