In about 5-8h of playtime you essentially become a witch's little helper, fight-fuck monster girls and catch them with pills pokemon-style. Unlike the first game, there is also some proper plot carrying the game. Only thing that might be disappointing at first is that it isn't really a sequel of Milky Quest 1, but you'll see what I mean if you have already played the first title.<br>(Oh, also, apparently the author is already working on a 3rd game.)",p={id:t,name:e,url:s,tags:a,stags:i,images:l,date:o,lang:n,censored:r,status:m,dev:h,dl:u,description:c};export{r as censored,o as date,p as default,c as description,h as dev,u as dl,t as id,l as images,n as lang,e as name,i as stags,m as status,a as tags,s as url};
